Info we need:
1. SSH public key for each user that requires git push access.

2. Domain Name, SSL certificate, SSL certificate key,  RootCA Certificate, and Intermediary Certificate.   Alternatively some vendors provide a bundled PEM file formatted for NGINX that includes all of the above.  In that case we would require only the PEM and KEY file.

3. Initial list of environment variables, and their values.
####Why the manual step?
Because we want to make sure:
- you understand our offerings
- you understand the basic settings of the platform (backup frequency, what disaster recovery means)
- what you're getting by using the platform (encryption, dedicated logging, dedicated monitoring etc.)
- we can clarify any questions you might have about HIPAA compliance
- we can discuss your application architecture and make sure there's a good fit with our offerings
- we discuss and clarify any questions you might have about our contractual terms and the terms and conditions of our services
