Please spend some time and carefully review your settings and data that you have entered. While it is possible to delete your app after it has been deployed in case of errors, I'm sure you would prefer not spending a bunch of time trying to figure out why something is not working. If there are errors at this point, you can always hit the yellow **Back** button. Please don't use the browser back button. While it mostly works, there are cases with specific browsers that might cause some issues.

Go ahead and click on the "Create Environment" button. Don't worry, it doesn't set up the containers for you quite yet.

What you will see is a screen that looks like this.
