# Define Services

> You can use an eraser on the drafting table or a sledge hammer on the construction site

Each of the software components that make up your application stack are called **services**. So the webapp, database are all called services in Catalyze.

I would word as such:

"Each component of your application, be it cahce, code or database is defined as a **service** in the Catalyze dashbaord. Each environment is then made up of a set of **services**"
