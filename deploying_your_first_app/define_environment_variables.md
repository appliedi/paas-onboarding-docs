# Define environment variables

> To be is to be the value of a variable.

OK, we're almost there. The last thing remaining is defining the list of environment variables that you would like defined in your app. The general format that needs to be followed is:
```
VARIABLE_NAME=WHATEVER_the_VAlU3
```

Example of environment variables include:
- `ENVIRONMENT_NAME` e.g. `ENVIRONMENT_NAME=development`
- `S3_KEY` e.g. `S3_KEY=8N029N81`
- `S3_SECRET` e.g. `S3_SECRET=9s83109d3+583493190`
- `NODE_ENV` e.g. `NODE_ENV=development`

and so on. More details can be got from [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars).

That's it!
