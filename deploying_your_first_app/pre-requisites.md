###Register for an account
To register for an account, go to https://dashboard.catalyze.io/signup and FIXME - then what?

To deploy your application, you will need to
1. first register for an account on the [dashboard](https://dashboard.catalyze.io/signup).
2. You will receive a confirmation email to verify your email address. Click on the link in the email and sign in.
3. Select Platform as a Service from the listing of services on your screen.
4.

Usually this will be preceded by a couple of conversations with us to ensure that we jointly understand:
- Whether we can support your requirements. Generally, if your solution is deployable on Heroku, it will work on the Catalyze PaaS. Custom buildpacks are also possible. You will need to get [in touch](support@catalyze.io) with us for that
-  Your overall architecture requirements - single node or highly available, database clustering requirements etc.
-  Your specific requirements around backup, disaster recovery, whether you need to store static content / assets and whether that need to be encrypted etc.
-  Pricing
-  The business associate agreement (BAA) and sign it



###Sign the Business Associate Agreement

If you boil it down, business associate agreements are just contracts that outline the ways in which different organizations are going to handle electronic protected health information (ePHI), the types of responsibilities that those organizations take on, some of the very specific rules around their obligations with regards to HIPAA. This last one, the obligations of subcontractors, is an area in which you want to pay close attention. Specifically read what the subcontractors obligations are in terms of timeliness of breach notification, because that was a part of the changes in the HIPAA Omnibus Rule that just went into effect. We have had several early customers come to us because the time period for breach notifications with their existing hosting provider is not acceptable for covered entities they are selling into. We’ve talked to several companies that have run into roadblocks with enterprises because their business associate agreements with their hosting providers had been out of line, and especially relating to breach notification. Our policy at Catalyze is breach notification within 4 hours, along with some very detailed [plans](http://goo.gl/Tpqs3t) to help you mitigate the risk of a breach.

We spent a lot of time and a lot of money with our attorneys on our BAAs because this is a new area, an area we don’t think is well defined yet; we don’t think the existing BAA templates are adequate or even make sense for most hosted vendors. In this new paradigm of health technology there are interesting definitions around which entities are responsible, both technically and financially in the case of a breach, for different aspects of the HIPAA rules. We tell our prospective customers to read their current business associated agreements that they have with their hosting providers or other services companies to get a sense of what the legal responsibility is for the business associate and the aspects to which the subcontractor is ultimately. Regardless of who is issuing the BAA, you should read through it in detail because at some point a compliance or security officer likely will read it and you want to be as proactive about compliance issues as you can.

So, we just want to spend a little bit of time with you to make sure you understand what we offer and what we're taking on, on your behalf.
