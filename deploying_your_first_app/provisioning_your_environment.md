# Provisioning your environment

After you've reviewed your information, click on the Provision button. This will provision the infrastructure needed to support your environment. Note that your credit card on file will also be billed.

At this stage, you will also be provided with a git url that is specific for your app that you need to use to deploy your app to. Again, as a reminder, you need to deploy this app using the pub SSH keys as discussed [earlier](./ssh_keys.html).
