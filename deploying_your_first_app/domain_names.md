###Overview

Because of the unique nature of SSL validation, provisioning SSL for your application is a multi-step process that involves several third-parties. You will need to:
- Purchase an SSL certificate from your SSL provider
- SSL endpoints are provisioned by default by Catalyze
- Upload the cert to Catalyze
- Update your DNS settings to reference the new SSL Endpoint URL

Additional details and steps are available  [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ssl-endpoint). [This Stack Overflow answer](http://serverfault.com/questions/9708/what-is-a-pem-file-and-how-does-it-differ-from-other-openssl-generated-key-file) might also provide some additional context around some of the terms used in this section. 


A couple of points to pay attention to when you are purchasing the certs:
- While generating the CSR, the Common Name field must match the secure domain **exactly**. If you buy a certificate for `example.com`, it won't match or secure `www.example.com`. 
- So, if you want to deploy:
  - A single sub-domain such as `app01.example.com`, then buy a cert that matches that exactly
  - Multiple apps on different subdomains i.e. if you intend to deploy mutiple apps `app01.example.com` and `app02.example.com`, then buy the wildcard cert i.e. speify the URL during purchase as `*.example.com`

To deploy and secure your apps on Catalyze, we need the following pieces of information that need to be pasted into the appropriate areas in the dashboard screenshow shown below.

- **URL / Domain name of the app**: As described above, you would use `app01.example.com` if you only intend to deploy the one app. If you intend to deploy several (dev, prod, qa etc.), you might choose to go with `*.example.com`

Quick note: please remember to click the blue (+) button to open the textbox to enter the information. Please also remember to click the blue (+) button *again* after entering the information. 

- **Corresponding SSL key**: Click on the blue (+) button in this box. This will open up a textbox. Paste the SSL key in here. And then click the blue (+) button again to close the box.

**SSL PEM**: You will also need the PEM for the Primary, Intermediate and RootCA authorities. Click on the blue **+** below each of them and paste the values in there. Details on how to go about generating and getting the PEMs are available [here](https://www.digicert.com/ssl-support/pem-ssl-creation.htm).Details and some explanation around what the PEM (also sometimes used interchangeably with .crt files) are also available [here](http://how2ssl.com/articles/working_with_pem_files/). Since various providers give this information to you differently. We'd recommend opening up the PEM file and copying and pasting the individual sections *including* the ``` ---- BEGIN ``` and ```END ----``` portions.

- **SSL Primary**: Click the blue (+) button and paste in the primary cert as shown below. Remember to include the ``` ---- BEGIN ``` and ```END ----``` portions. And remember to close it again after entering the info.

- **Intermediary**: This is optional and often depends on the certificate provider. We haven't provided you with a screenshot of this but if you have this information, please paste it in as well.
- **Rootca**: Again, click the blue (+), paste the cert including the ``` ---- BEGIN ``` and ```END ----``` portions. And remember to close it again after entering the info.

After adding all these pieces of information, your screen should look something like this. Note that the Intermediary box has an *unlocked* icon on it as no information was entered there.

After pasting the info above, click on the **Add Domain** button and you should see the domain you just added show up in the listing below as shown below.

You're now ready to specify which users will have access to Catalyze to push code to the containers in your environment.
