# The Catalyze Platform as a Service (PaaS)

> Privacy is not something that I'm merely entitled to, it's an absolute prerequisite.

The biggest [value][2] that a platform as a service provides is to simplify the developers life to allow them to focus on their application rather than the nuances and complexities of deployment and server configurations. Add to that all the additional requirements around complying with regulations, mandates and certifications (HIPAA, HITRUST etc.) in healthcare and the developer's challenges are multiplied tenfold. We want to make it as easy for a developer to build a compliant healthcare application on Catalyze as it is to deploy an app on [Heroku][1]. With this goal in mind, we set out to design and build out the Catalyze Platform as a Service.

Using Heroku so many times seems odd to me. Instead of user Heroku, couldn't we say:

"We want to make it as easy for a developer to build a compliant healthcare application on Catalyze as it is to deploy an app with a simple command" or something to that effect.

#### Catalyze makes it easy to deploy, secure and scale apps in the cloud. Catalyze gets out of the way—allowing you to build things your way, with the tools you love—with the assurance that your hosting environment will be HIPAA compliant and HITRUST certified.

The Catalyze Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) is built on top of existing IaaS vendors such as Amazon Web Services and Rackspace. It manages

* web servers
* application servers, and
* database servers

and goes further by setting up and securing
* encrypted network connections
* disk encryption
* encrypted backups
* disaster recovery
* dedicated logging servers and
* dedicated monitoring servers

Each of these will be explained in more detail in subsequent sections.

Note that you will see a lot of references to Heroku throughout this document. We are, however, **not** affiliated with Heroku.
