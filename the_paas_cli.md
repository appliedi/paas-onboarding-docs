# The PaaS CLI

> I can’t abide that contraption attached to the computer which must be gripped to navigate a cursor round a computer screen, a move which necessitates removing one’s hands from the keyboard and removing it to a misshapen blob, interrupting the flow of work.

>   — William M. Briggs



COMING SOON.


The CLI (command line interface) is currently in alpha testing with a few select customers. Please let us know if you would like to be included in that list.
