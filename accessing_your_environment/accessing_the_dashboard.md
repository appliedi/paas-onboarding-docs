# Accessing the dashboard

> â€”

Login to the dashboard using the credentials you created earlier.

You will see a screen that looks something like this:

![View Deployed App](../pics/32.view.deployed.app.png)

You can click on View (right next to the environment name) or the Overview link to the right to see a summary screen of the containers that have been deployed and their status.

![View Deployed Summary](../pics/33.view.deployed.summary.png)

You can click on the green show buttons next to each variable that you specified to see what you entered. Additionally, you can modify / add variables by clicking on the Update button next to each section (coming soon). Once you update them, the variables will come into effect the next time you do a git push and re-deploy your app.
