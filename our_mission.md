# Our mission


###Maximize Security
Security and compliance are at the core of what we provide. So everything that we do has to have those two goals in mind. Our customers manage sensitive data. It is our responsibility to ensure the highest level of security possible while mitigating whatever possible attack surfaces that we are aware of. That also implies that we continue to monitor, test and secure our PaaS to ensure that we continue to provide the highest level of security possible.


###Simplify Compliance
Compliance with regulations is challenging. It is our responsibility to stay abreast of these regulations and implement them as much as possible into the offering. Policies put into place internally are **important** and there for a reason. Adherence to them is essential for **our** business continuity so we take them seriously.


###Parity with "mainstream" software development
Software development platforms like Heroku and Parse revolutionized software development. It is our intention and mission to bring that same revolution to healthcare software development.


###Rival Heroku in ease of use and reliability
They are the gold standard for Platform as Service at scale. We should plan to match and exceed their capabilities at every level.

###Customer service is paramount
We wouldn't exist without our customers. We will strive our utmost to provide the best customer service possible. We will be transparent if we make mistakes. We will work to rectify them immediately. All we ask for from our customers is trust (which we will work to earn) and a little bit of patience (we are a start up after all).

### Zero access cloud
The Catalyze PaaS must be designed with the concept of a **zero access cloud** in mind. What this implies is that we do not want to have or even be able to access our customer's environment and data without their explicit consent.
